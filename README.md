# Front End Technical Tasks

Please find assets for each technical task included within this repository. We recommend forking this repo or sending us a link to a codepen (http://codepen.io/).

We don't expect everything to be a perfect match. It's open book, feel free to hit Google but be prepared to explain your solution.
